Webpage to display some exercise projects of my learning journey on Web Development.
It can be accessed live [here](https://martabosch.tech/).

## Future works
Besides adding more projects to display, a preview of each one and a link to their code are on its way. Until then one can access the code of the front-end projects on my [Projects repository](https://github.com/mrtbsc/Projects), the code for the first express app on my [first-express-app repo](https://github.com/mrtbsc/first-express-app) and the Blog's code on my [blog-app repo](https://github.com/mrtbsc/blog-app).

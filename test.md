This is the first backend-app I built as an exercise. It is a basic CRUD app that displays a team of artists:

It shows their names, bio and an associated photo of their art.
New artists can be added and current ones can be modified or deleted.
✔ It was built using node.js, express and ejs templating.

❌ To keep it as simple as an express app could get, no database was associated and only minimal CSS was used.
